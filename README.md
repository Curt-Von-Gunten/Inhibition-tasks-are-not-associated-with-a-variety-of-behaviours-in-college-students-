# Inhibition-tasks-are-not-associated-with-a-variety-of-behaviours-in-college-students

This repository contains the data and coding scripts used for the paper, 'Inhibition tasks are note associated with a variety of behaviours in college students'. 
Journal article: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/per.2250

The processing pipeline for this project was fairley complex and for better or worse it used a mix of Python, R, Mplus, and SAS.

If you use the data or the scripts, I suggest contacting me so that I can point you in the right direction. It's possible that I may have missed some intermediate scripts. For each script, I suggest first looking at the file name that the script reads as input and the file name that it outputs. Eventually, or at someone's request, I may put step-by-step instructions of how to run the pipeline to get from the raw files to the final tables and figures.

Note that the following inhbition task raw files are not here because they were too large. You can find them at the OSF repository, which contains everything in this repository along with these files:
Simon_Both.csv
Stroop_Both.csv
Go_NoGo_Both.csv
