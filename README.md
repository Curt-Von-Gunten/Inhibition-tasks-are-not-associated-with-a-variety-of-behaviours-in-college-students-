# Inhibition-tasks-are-not-associated-with-a-variety-of-behaviours-in-college-students

This repository contains the data and coding scripts used for the paper, 'Inhibition tasks are note associated with a variety of behaviours in college students'.

The processing pipeline for this project was fairley complex and for better or worse it used a mix of Python, R, Mplus, and SAS.

If you use the data or the scripts, I suggest contacting me so that I can point you in the right direction. It's possible that I may have missed some intermediate scripts. For each script, I suggest first looking at the file name that the script reads as input and the file name that it outputs. Eventually, or at someone's request, I may put step-by-step instructions of how to run the pipeline to get from the raw files to the final tables and figures.
